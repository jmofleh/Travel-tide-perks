# Personalized Loyalty Strategy Using Customer Analytics at TravelTide

A data-driven project that leverages customer analytics and machine learning to design a highly personalized loyalty program for TravelTide. The analysis uncovers meaningful customer segments and maps them to reward offerings that align with real user behavior, supporting higher engagement, retention, and long-term customer value.

## 🚀 Project Overview

TravelTide is exploring the launch of a customer loyalty program as part of its growth strategy. Rather than offering a one-size-fits-all rewards system, this project uses behavioral data to identify distinct customer groups and recommend targeted perks.

The project focuses on:

* Segmenting customers based on booking behavior and engagement
* Understanding which incentives resonate with each segment
* Translating analytical findings into practical business recommendations


## 🏢 Business Context

In today’s competitive online travel market, personalized experiences are increasingly important. This project supports TravelTide’s goal of building a loyalty program grounded in customer behavior rather than assumptions.

Key focus areas:

* **Behavior-Based Customer Grouping** – Identify natural groupings using unsupervised learning
* **Reward–Relevance Mapping** – Determine which perks best suit each segment
* **Insight-Driven Planning** – Provide actionable guidance for marketing and product teams



## 🔍 Analytical Approach

* Explored and cleaned customer data
* Engineered behavioral features from booking and session data
* Applied K-Means clustering to generate customer segments
* Validated clusters using quantitative techniques
* Interpreted segment characteristics to infer reward preferences


## 🧠 Project Capabilities

* Customer behavior and booking trend analysis
* Machine learning–based segmentation
* Cluster validation with statistical metrics
* Segment-level reward affinity analysis
* Strategic recommendations for loyalty program design



## 📊 Strategic Outcomes

Findings support the creation of a flexible loyalty program that may include:

* Tiered membership levels
* Bundled or combined perks
* Segment-specific incentives

This approach enables TravelTide to move away from generic rewards and toward a targeted, customer-centric loyalty strategy.
